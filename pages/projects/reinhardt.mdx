# Reihardt Hammer HID

I used a real hammer to control reinhardt in OverWatch2.

## Description

I want to play Reinhardt in OW2 with immersive experience and, luckily, I have a hammer in my house.


## Things I used
- 1 **Arduino Uno R3** (DON'T USE IT FOR HID. USE LEONARD INSTEAD U NOOB)

Uno doesn't support for HID, pc detects it like normal serial port, so please buy Micro or Leonadro, period.
- 1 **MPU6050**

- 1 Joy Stick module

- 2 Push switches

## How it went
I attached an accelerometer, MPU6050, with a hammer to detect its swing and send some values to arduino.

If I swing the hammer faster than 6G, then it will send signal as "click".

The arduino will send "click" as JSON to javascript server via serial port to perform a left clikc in OW2
which is a single hammer hit.

( I did came up with rf for arduino-pc communication at the time but I had tried it and , somehow, it just didn't work. I knew it later that it needs a capacitor to filter noise out.)


and I also applied with joy stick module to control movement of Reinhardt.
