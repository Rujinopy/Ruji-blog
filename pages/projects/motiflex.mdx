## Description

Motiflex is an app designed to boost your motivation by using your money as a pledge, ensuring you stick to your workout routine. We employ computer vision AI, powered by Tensorflow, to monitor and count your exercises.

Currently, we offer three exciting challenges: push-ups, sit-ups, and weight lifting. ðŸ˜„
